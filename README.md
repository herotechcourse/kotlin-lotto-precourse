## Test

### Parser Test

#### ToInt Function Tests

- **Valid input conversion**: Confirms that valid numeric strings are correctly converted to integers
- **Non-numeric input handling**: Verifies that an exception is thrown when attempting to parse non-numeric text
- **Empty string handling**: Ensures an appropriate exception is thrown when an empty string is provided

#### ToIntList Function Tests

- **Valid comma-separated values**: Verifies that strings with comma-separated numbers are correctly converted to integer lists
- **Whitespace handling**: Confirms that the parser handles inputs with extra spaces around the numbers
- **Invalid value detection**: Ensures that exceptions are thrown when any value in the list is non-numeric
- **Empty string handling**: Verifies that empty strings are properly rejected with an exception

### Money Test

#### MoneyCreationTest

Tests the creation of Money objects:

- **createMoneyWithValidAmount**: Verifies Money objects can be created with valid amounts
- **throwExceptionWhenAmountIsNull**: Ensures exception is thrown when amount is null
- **throwExceptionWhenAmountIsLessThanMinimum**: Confirms exception is thrown for amounts below 1000

#### MoneyBehaviorTest 

Tests the behavior of Money objects:

- **getAmountShouldReturnCorrectValue**: Verifies the getter returns the correct amount
- **shouldAllowMaximumValidAmount**: Ensures the class handles the maximum integer value

#### Key Validations

- Money cannot be created with null values
- Money amount must be at least 1000
- Money objects correctly store and return their amount values

### Prize Test

#### Constructor Tests

- Validates that the constructor throws an exception when given a negative match count
- Ensures the constructor accepts valid match counts (0-6)

#### getRank Method Tests

- Validates correct rank determination based on match count and bonus ball status:
  - FIRST rank: 6 matches
  - SECOND rank: 5 matches with bonus ball
  - THIRD rank: 5 matches without bonus ball
  - FOURTH rank: 4 matches
  - FIFTH rank: 3 matches
  - NONE rank: 0-2 matches

#### getReward Method Tests

- Confirms that the correct prize amount is returned for each rank:
  - Validates rewards for all ranks from FIRST to NONE
  - Ensures different rewards for 5 matches with/without bonus ball

### Winner Test

#### Constructor Validation Tests

These tests verify that the `Winner` constructor properly validates its input parameters:

- Ensures that a valid list of numbers and bonus number can create a Winner instance
- Verifies exceptions are thrown for the following invalid inputs:
  - Empty numbers list
  - Numbers list with incorrect size (not 6 numbers)
  - Numbers outside the valid range (1-45)
  - Duplicate numbers in the list
  - Bonus number outside valid range (1-45)
  - Bonus number that appears in the winning numbers list

## Methods Tests

These tests verify the behavior of the `Winner` class methods:

- `getNumbers()` returns the correct list of winning numbers
- `getBonus()` returns the correct bonus number

### Lotto Util Test

#### isValidLottoNumber

- Validates that numbers between 1 and 45 are accepted
- Validates that numbers outside the range (0, -5, 46, 100) are rejected
- Validates that null inputs are rejected

#### isValidLottoSize

- Verifies that collections with exactly 6 elements are accepted
- Verifies that collections with fewer or more than 6 elements are rejected
- Verifies that null or empty collections are rejected

#### generateNumbers

- Ensures the function generates 6 unique numbers
- Ensures all generated numbers are within the valid range (1-45)

#### getMatchCount

- Verifies correct counting of matching numbers between a lotto ticket and winning numbers
- Tests edge cases: no matches and all matches

#### isMatchBonus

- Checks correct detection of bonus number presence in a lotto ticket
- Verifies negative cases where bonus number is not present

#### calculateProfit

- Ensures accurate calculation of total prize money from multiple prizes
- Verifies that empty prize list returns zero profit

#### calculateProfitRate

- Validates correct calculation of profit rate as percentage (profit/spent Ã— 100)
- Ensures proper handling of various profit and spending scenarios
- Confirms proper rounding to one decimal place

### Lotto Machine Test
