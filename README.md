## 🛠️ Development Flow
- Follows a structured development flow designed for<br>
    clarity, testability, and maintainability:

    ### 1. **FDD (Feature-Driven Development)**
    - Break the program into small features<br>
    that are easy to develop and test.

    ### 2. **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
    - Write tests first to check that each feature works correctly.

    ### 3. **MVC + SR Refactoring**
    - Organize the code by responsibility.
    - Model, View, Controller, Service, Repository.
