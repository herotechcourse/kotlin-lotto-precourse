## Limitations & Assumptions

1. **Program stays alive after any `IllegalArgumentException`;** it prints `[ERROR] â€¦` and re-prompts the current step
   only.
2. Winning numbers input must meet all of the following conditions.
    - No empty values are allowed.(blank input is not valid).
    - All inputs must be valid numbers.
    - Each number must be between 1 and 45.
    - Duplicate numbers are not allowed.
