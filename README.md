# Lotto Game

## üöÄ Project Introduction

This is a simple console-based Lotto game where the user purchases lotto tickets, inputs winning numbers and a bonus ball, and calculates the return rate based on the result.

This project is implemented in Kotlin and utilizes the `camp.nextstep.edu.missionutils` library for random number generation and console input handling.

## ‚ú® Features

Here is a list of the implemented features. Each feature is managed by a separate Git commit following the AngularJS commit conventions.

-   **[feature] Input Purchase Amount:**
    -   Accepts the amount of money to purchase Lotto tickets.
    -   1 ticket = 1000 KRW.

    -   Automatically generates 6 unique random numbers per ticket within the range 1‚Äì45.

-   **[feature] Input Winning Numbers:**
    -   Accepts 6 unique numbers separated by commas.

-   **[feature] Input Bonus Ball:**
    -   Accepts a single bonus ball number separately.

-   **[feature] Validate Inputs:**
    -   Purchase amount must be a positive integer and a multiple of 1000.
    -   Lotto numbers must be 6 unique integers between 1 and 45.
    -   Bonus ball must be between 1 and 45 and not duplicate a winning number.

-   **[feature] Match Results:**

-   **[feature] Calculate Return Rate:**
    -   Calculates and prints the total return rate based on prizes won.

-   **[feature] Exception Handling:**
    -   Throws `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid inputs and prints an error message without abruptly terminating the application.

-   **[feature] Write Test Code:**
    -   Use JUnit 5 and AssertJ for unit tests.
    -   Use `mission-utils` test library to simulate random value generation and console input.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

-   Kotlin 1.9.24
-   Gradle
-   `camp.nextstep.edu.missionutils` library (provided)
