## üöÄ About This Program - Lotto

---

This is a simple lottery program that simulates purchasing and evaluating lottery tickets.

- The price of one lottery ticket is **1,000 KRW**.
- When the user enters a purchase amount, the program issues as many tickets as the budget allows.

  *(The maximum allowed amount is 100,000 KRW.)*

- The user is then prompted to enter **6 winning numbers** and **1 bonus number**.
- The program compares all purchased tickets with the winning numbers and prints:
    - the number of winning tickets by prize tier
    - the total winnings
    - and the profit rate.

If the user enters an invalid value, the program:

- shows an error message starting with `[ERROR]`,
- throws an exception,
- and re-prompts the input starting from the step where the error occurred.

There are five prize tiers from 1st to 5th place. The match conditions and prize amounts are described below.

| Rank | Match Condition                   | Prize Amount (KRW) |
|------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1st  | 6 matching numbers                | 2,000,000,000 KRW  |
| 2nd  | 5 matching numbers + bonus number | 30,000,000 KRW     |
| 3rd  | 5 matching numbers                | 1,500,000 KRW      |
| 4th  | 4 matching numbers                | 50,000 KRW         |
| 5th  | 3 matching numbers                | 5,000 KRW          |
