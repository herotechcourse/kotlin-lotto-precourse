# Lotto

This project written in Kotlin simulates a simple ticket machine for the Lottery.

User can buy lottery tickets and then compare if their numbers match the winning ones. Depending on how many numbers match, an amount of money will be assigned as a prize and the winning rate of return will be displayed.

> **Note:** when the user enters the winning numbers to compare against their tickets, they are not choosing a new winning number, they are entering the result of the last draw.

## Key features

### 1. Input purchase amount

- Validate that the input is a number divisible by 1000
- Invalid input triggers an IllegalArgumentException and a retry
- Calculate number of tickets to issue

### 2. Generate random tickets

- Each ticket contains 6 random numbers between 1 and 45
- Validate that the numbers are not repeated
- Sort the numbers in ascending order

### 3. Display tickets

- Show generated tickets on screen

### 4. Input winner numbers

- Validate that entered numbers are 6, separated by a comma
- Validate that numbers are unique and within the range 1-45
- Invalid input triggers an IllegalArgumentException and a retry.

### 5. Input bonus number

- Validate there is a single number and within the range 1-45
- Validate it is not one of the winning numbers
- Invalid input triggers an IllegalArgumentException and a retry.

### 6. Show winning stadistics

- Compare each ticket´s numbers to the winning numbers
- Determine prize rank based on the matchs
- Calculate return rate based in total winnings and spent amount
- Display the amount of tickets per rank
- Display the return percentage on screen (rounded to one decimal place)

## Testing

- Unit tests are written using **JUnit 5** and **AssertJ**.
- Tests cover input validation, ticket generation, number comparison, and prize calculation.
