## Misconception
* I don't understand what to do with the bonus number or bonus ball `2nd Prize: Match 5 numbers + bonus number / 30,000,000 KRW`, should I match 5 numbers and the bonus, so match 6 numbers? or match 5 numbers then multiply 30 Million by bonus number of tickets, I don't know, since it's written `If something is not explicitly stated in the functional requirements, use your own judgment to implement it.`, I will assume the more convenient for me, which is match 5 numbers and the bonus, so 6 numbers, if these 6 numbers matched, 2nd prize.
