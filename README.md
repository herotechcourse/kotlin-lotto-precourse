### step 1: Initialise the application entry point
- `fun main()` is the standard entry point in kotlin
- `LottoGame().run()` creates an instance of the game and runs it.

### step 2: Create Controller for controlling program flow

- `InputView` : Allows us to read input     

####  The controller:
   - Calculates how many lotto tickets to generate
   - Hands the lotto ticket generation to `LottoMachine`
   - Prints ticket data using `OutputView`
