# kotlin-lotto-precourse

This Lotto program implements a simple lottery ticket machine in Kotlin. Users enter a purchase amount, and the program generates as many lottery tickets as possible, with each ticket containing 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45. After generating tickets, users input the winning numbers and a bonus number. The program then compares all the tickets against the winning combination based on predefined prize ranks (from 1st to 5th place) and calculates the total winnings and overall profit rate.

To do list:
- prompt user input purchase amount
- implement invalid user input
- implement budget logic
